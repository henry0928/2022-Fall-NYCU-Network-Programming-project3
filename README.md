# 2022-Fall-NYCU-Network-Programming-project3

The project is divided into two parts.

First part:

Here, you are asked to write a simple HTTP server called http server and a CGI program console.cgi.
We will use Boost.Asio library to accomplish this project.

Second part:

For this part, you are asked to provides the same functionality as part 1, but with some rules slightly
differs:
1. Implement one program, cgi server.exe, which is a combination of http server, panel.cgi, and
console.cgi.
2. Your program should run on Windows 10.
